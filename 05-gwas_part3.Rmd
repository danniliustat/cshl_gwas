This section introduces a hands-on practice of a genome-wide association study with binary traits. The reference paper provided a criteria to define the binary groups. The groups were divided based on MR(metabolite ratio) values, such that groups are coded as 1 if MR < 0.0146 and 0 if MR>= 0.0146. We will adopt their citeria in this notebook to define the binary groups. Then we perform a genome-wide case/control association analysis for the binary traits.

Reference paper: Hennig EE, Piatkowska M, Goryca K, Pospiech E, Paziewska A, Karczmarski J, Kluska A, Brewczynska E, Ostrowski J "[Non-CYP2D6 variants selected by GWAS improved the prediction of impaired tamoxifen metabolism in breast cancer patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6722498/)."

```{bash eval=F}
# change the path below to where you saved "cshl_2024" folder
## run in R Terminal
mydir="/path/to/cshl_2024/Data/case_data_binary"
cd $mydir
```

```{r eval=F}
# R codes- run in R Console
setwd("/path/to/cshl_2024/Data/case_data_binary")
mydir<-getwd()
```

## Data Preparation
1. Phenotype data (using R):
  + We convert the continuous trait of `Z-endoxifen ratio` from the previous notebook to binary traits based on the cut-off value 0.0146:
  + Values greater than 0.0146 are coded as 1
  + Values less than 0.0146 are coded as 2
2. Genotype data:
  + genotype.ped
  + genotype.map

The following code load the imputed phenotype data `phenotype0.txt` and extract our target phenotype data of `Z-endoxifen ratio`. Then, we convert the continuous traits into binary traits, and save the binary group variable `binary_pheno0` to file `binary_phenotype0.txt`.

```{r}
# R codes- run in R Console
pheno0=fread("phenotype0.txt",header=F) #read phenotype data
binary_pheno0=pheno0[,3]
binary_pheno0[binary_pheno0>=0.0146]=1 #code values greater than 0 as 1
binary_pheno0[binary_pheno0<0.0146]=2 #code values less than 0 as 2
write.table(binary_pheno0,"binary_phenotype0.txt",quote=F,row.names=F,col.names=F,sep=" ") #save binary phenotype data
head(binary_pheno0)
```

After the binary group is ready, we use the same procedure in section 5.3 of last notebook to prepare PLINK alternate phenotype file (in Linux):

Note: famID.txt and samID.txt are both required for PLINK step. They are already prepared in last notebook.

```{bash}
## bash codes- run in terminal
paste famID.txt samID.txt binary_phenotype0.txt > binary_phenotype.txt
```

Take a look at the prepared phenotype data.

```{r}
# R codes- run in R Console
binary_pheno<-read.table("binary_phenotype.txt")
head(binary_pheno)
```

## Genome-Wide Case/Control Association Test (in PLINK)
Similar as last notebook, we will still use PLINK to perform association test. The only change is the phenotype file.

The following code conducts the genome-wide association test by PLINK in bash code. This code will take several minutes to finish.
```{bash eval=F}
## # both Mac and Windows can run in Terminal
# windows users
../../Tools/PLINK/plink_win64_20231211/plink.exe \
--noweb --file genotype_1k --assoc --pheno binary_phenotype.txt --adjust --all-pheno --out younameit
```
```{bash}
# macOS users
../../Tools/PLINK/plink_mac_20231211/plink \
--noweb --file genotype_1k --assoc --pheno binary_phenotype.txt --adjust --all-pheno --out younameit
```

1. **--noweb** suppress checking for new version,
2. **--file** specifies .ped and .map files, 
3. **--assoc** performs case/control or QTL association, you can also perform other tests by changing the options,
4. **--pheno** specifies alternate phenotype, 
5. **--adjust** generates a file of adjusted significance values that correct for all tests performed and other metrics, 
6. **--all-pheno** performs association test for all phenotypes in binary_phenotype.tix file, 
7. **--out** specifies output filename. 

This will generate the files **younameit.P1.assoc** with fields as follows:

     CHR     Chromosome
     
     SNP     SNP ID
     
     BP      Physical position (base-pair)
     
     A1      Minor allele name (based on whole sample)
     
     F_A     Frequency of this allele in cases
     
     F_U     Frequency of this allele in controls
     
     A2      Major allele name
     
     CHISQ   Basic allelic test chi-square (1df)
     
     P       Asymptotic p-value for this test
     
     OR      Estimated odds ratio (for A1, i.e. A2 is reference)     

**--adjust** generates the file **younameit.adjust**, which contains the following fields

     CHR         Chromosome number
           
     SNP         SNP identifer
           
     UNADJ       Unadjusted p-value
           
     GC          Genomic-control corrected p-values
           
     BONF        Bonferroni single-step adjusted p-values
           
     HOLM        Holm (1979) step-down adjusted p-values
           
     SIDAK_SS    Sidak single-step adjusted p-values
           
     SIDAK_SD    Sidak step-down adjusted p-values
           
     FDR_BH      Benjamini & Hochberg (1995) step-up FDR control
           
     FDR_BY      Benjamini & Yekutieli (2001) step-up FDR control 
     
## Manhattan Plot and Q-Q Plot
Similar to the GWAS study for continuous traits, we generate Manhattan Plot and Q-Q Plot to visualize the results of GWAS test.

The Manhattan plot is a good way to visualize the resuls of GWAS test. For more details, please refer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_plot

The Q-Q plot for GWAS is another way to visualize the signals. For more details, please refer:https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Code_Sample:_Generating_QQ_Plots_in_R

qqman is an R package for creating Q-Q and manhattan plots from GWAS results. See the reference page http://www.gettinggeneticsdone.com/2014/05/qqman-r-package-for-qq-and-manhattan-plots-for-gwas-results.html.

The qqman R package assumes you have columns named SNP, CHR, BP, and P, corresponding to the SNP name (rs number), chromosome number, base-pair position, and p-value.

The following code prepares qqman R input files (CHR, SNP, BP, P) (in Linux)
```{bash}
## bash codes- run in terminal
awk '{print $1,$2,$3,$9}' younameit.P1.assoc > P1.assoc
```

Here is sample data for P1.assoc

    CHR     SNP        BP     P

     1      rs9701055  565433 0.757

     1      rs3094315  752566 0.7004

     1      rs2073813  753541 0.467

     1      rs3131969  754182 0.131

Load association results. Loaded results are in `assoc`.

```{r}
# R codes- run in R Console
assoc=fread("P1.assoc", header=T)
assoc=assoc[(assoc$CHR!=0) & (!is.na(assoc$P)),]
head(assoc)
```

## Generate Manhattan plot

We use the same commands as continuous trait to generate a Manhattan plot. The following code will take several minutes to finish.
```{r}
# R codes- run in R Console
png(filename=paste0("Manhattan_Plot_for_binary_z-endoxifen_ratio.png"), type="cairo")
manhattan(assoc, col=c("dimgray", "darkgoldenrod1"), suggestiveline=F, genomewideline=F)
dev.off()
```

```{r mahbiny}
# R codes- run in R Console
img <- readPNG("Manhattan_Plot_for_binary_z-endoxifen_ratio.png")
grid::grid.raster(img)
```

This plot is very similar compared with the Manhattan plot we got for continuous trait. They both contain a very significant SNP in chromosome 22, however, this SNP for binary trait is not so significant as for continuous trait. The y-axis value for continuous trait is about 20.

## Generate Q-Q plot

Similarly, a Q-Q plot is generated with qq function to visualize the test results. This code will take several minutes to finish.
```{r}
# R codes- run in R Console
png(filename=paste0("Q-Q_Plot_for_binary_z-endoxifen_ratio.png"), type="cairo")
qq(assoc$P)
dev.off()
```
```{r mahbiny2}
# R codes- run in R Console
img <- readPNG("Q-Q_Plot_for_binary_z-endoxifen_ratio.png")
grid::grid.raster(img)
```

Q-Q plot still has a long tail, meaning that there are causal polymorphisms.

## Multiple-Test Correction
Again, since we simultaneously test the significance of each SNP, we need to control the overall type-I error rate using false discovery rate (FDR).

**Prepare R input files (in Linux)**
The following code extracts the CHR, SNP, UNADJ, FDR_BH from the PLINK output younameit.adjusted. The results are stored in the files: P1.assoc.adjusted.
```{bash}
## bash codes- run in terminal
awk '{print $1,$2,$3,$9}' younameit.P1.assoc.adjusted > P1.assoc.adjusted
```

**Significant SNPs after a multiple-test correction of FDR (using R)**
The following code identifies the significant SNPs by the FDR adjusted p-values with cutoff 0.05.
```{r}
# R codes- run in R Console
assoc.adjusted=fread("P1.assoc.adjusted")#load association results
sigidx=which(assoc.adjusted$FDR_BH<0.05) #index of significant SNPs
sigSNP=assoc.adjusted[sigidx,] #extract association results for significant SNPs
write.table(sigSNP, "significant_SNPs_for_z-endoxifen_ratio.txt", row.names=F, col.names=T, quote=F, sep=" ") #save results

#view result
dim(sigSNP)
head(sigSNP)
```

There are 79 significant SNPs identified. However, remember that we have many SNPs with kgp identifiers, we still need to check if they have matched rs identifiers using UCSC Table Browser.

First we need to match genotype information such as position.

```{r}
# R codes- run in R Console
map<- fread("genotype_1k.map",header=F)
names(map) <- c("CHR","SNP","GP","BP") # assign header
zr_result <- fread("significant_SNPs_for_z-endoxifen_ratio.txt")
idx <- match(zr_result$SNP, map$SNP)#index of map that match with SNP in result
zr_result$BP <- map$BP[idx]
head(zr_result)
dim(zr_result) #get number of significant SNPs
```

Next, we will extract the SNPs with kgp identifier, and prepare the table that will be submitted to UCSC.

```{r}
# R codes- run in R Console
kgp_snps <- zr_result[grepl("kgp",zr_result$SNP),]
head(kgp_snps)
kgp_snps$CHR<- paste0("chr",kgp_snps$CHR)
kgp_snps$BP_1<- kgp_snps$BP-1
fwrite(kgp_snps[,c("CHR","BP_1","BP","SNP")], "kgp_snps.txt", sep=" ", quote=F, row.name=F, col.name=F)
```

After matching, we again got only 2 matched SNPs, same as in continuous study.

```{r}
# R codes- run in R Console
kgp_rs<- fread("kgp_rs.txt",header=F)
names(kgp_rs)<- c("CHR","BP_1","BP","SNP")# assign header
idx <- match(kgp_rs$BP, kgp_snps$BP)# get index of these matched SNPs in results
kgp_match<- kgp_snps[idx[!is.na(idx)],]
kgp_match$SNP<- kgp_rs$SNP[!is.na(idx)] # replace kgp identifier with rs identifier
kgp_match
```

After combining with other rs identified SNPs, we got a total of 29 significant SNPs after multiple test correction.
```{r}
# R codes- run in R Console
rs_snps <- zr_result[grepl("rs",zr_result$SNP),]
kgp_match$CHR <- "22"
rs_snps <- rbind(rs_snps, kgp_match[,-6])
fwrite(rs_snps, "significant_snps_with_rs_for_z-endoxifen-ratio.txt", sep=" ", quote=F, row.name=F, col.name=T)
dim(rs_snps)
rs_snps
```

## Top 10 SNPs
Here, we present the Top 10 SNPs and p-values for both binary and continuous Z-endoxifen ratio trait.

```{r}
# R codes- run in R Console
# binary trait
assoc_binary=read.table("significant_snps_with_rs_for_z-endoxifen-ratio.txt",header=T) #load association results for binary_r_met
ordered_assoc_binary=assoc_binary[order(assoc_binary$FDR_BH),] #order association results based on p-value
head(ordered_assoc_binary,10) #association results for the top 10 SNPs with the 10 smallest p-values
```

```{r}
# R codes- run in R Console
# continuous trait
assoc_cont=read.table("../case_data/significant_snps_with_rs_for_z-endoxifen-ratio.txt",header=T) #load association results for binary_r_met
ordered_assoc_cont=assoc_cont[order(assoc_cont$FDR_BH),] #order association results based on p-value
head(ordered_assoc_cont,10) #association results for the top 10 SNPs with the 10 smallest p-values
```
