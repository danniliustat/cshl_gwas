MAGMA is a self-contained executable and does not need to be installed. It runs from the command line, using the 'cmd' program (search in Windows for "cmd" or "Command Prompt" to find it).
From the command line, either go to the directory the magma.exe executable is in or copy magma.exe to your working directory. 
The program can now be run by entering 'magma' followed by the desired arguments at the command line. 

Documentation and auxiliary files can be found on the MAGMA site at http://ctglab.nl/software/magma
